# Machine-Learning-Tasks
# 🍽️ Restaurant Recommendation System

This project is a complete machine learning and data analysis solution focused on restaurant data. It demonstrates how to clean, analyze, and model real-world data to predict ratings, recommend restaurants, classify cuisines, and perform geographic analysis.

---

##  Objective

The goal is to explore restaurant-related data using data science techniques to solve the following tasks:

-  Predict restaurant ratings based on key features.
-  Recommend restaurants using content-based filtering.
-  Classify restaurants based on their cuisine type.
- 🗺 Perform location-based analysis of restaurant distribution.

## Tasks Overview

###  Task 1: Predict Restaurant Ratings
- Built a Linear Regression model to predict the `Aggregate rating` of a restaurant.
- Used features like location, price range, votes, and delivery options.
- Evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (R²)** score.

###  Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System
- Built a **content-based filtering** system to recommend restaurants based on:
  - Cuisine preference
  - Price range
  - Table booking availability
- Filtered top-rated matches and visualized them using bar charts.

###  Task 3: Cuisine Classification
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict a restaurant's `Cuisine`.
- Focused on the **top 10 cuisines** to reduce class imbalance.
- Evaluated with **precision**, **recall**, **f1-score**, and **confusion matrix**.

###  Task 4: Location-Based Analysis
- Used **latitude** and **longitude** to map restaurant locations.
- Created:
  - Scatter plots of restaurant density by location.
  - Bar plots of average rating and count by city.
  - An **interactive map** using **Folium** (saved as `restaurant_map.html`).
